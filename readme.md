Small project created to track gw2 trading post. 


It was created in a rush to get the high in prices of charms. 

What it do: 
* runes:   it track Superior runes  buy price and do some calc to see the proffit on disenchanting them and selling the charms.
(it can be improved, to notify instead of runing on each iteration, not sure if i'll take the time to do so, it will only last 20 days)

TODOS:  
* track prices for buying charms using runes (not selling)
* Track rare / exotic itens to buy ecto in a cheaper price
